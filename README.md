# Unofficial keyauth rust library
https://docs.rs/keyauth/latest/keyauth/

# note
a lot of code is from the official keyauth library,
now you may ask why does this even exist if its the same code from the official library?
well the official library is old and uses 1.0 api only this has all 3 api versions and also seller api additionaly its on crates.io so you can just import it in Cargo.toml

# TODO
pre obfuscated version using https://docs.rs/goldberg/latest/goldberg/
